# CNCF Trademark and Account Assignment Agreements

This folder contains the [deprecated trademark agreements](https://github.com/cncf/foundation/tree/main/agreements/deprecated) that CNCF projects used to transfer trademarks to the Linux Foundation.

Projects will now complete a "[Contribution Agreement](https://github.com/cncf/foundation/tree/main/agreements/Sample%20Contribution%20Agreement%20(2025).pdf)" that is generated as a Google document for them. This will then be executed via Docusign by the contributors and the LF.

The new process follows the [CNCF Governing Board's approval](https://www.cncf.io/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/2024-Oct-09-GB-Voting-Results.pdf) of a [resolution](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1jeSSq8LvpRaw_6GWNeGjVEV0n9WoCJ-x3oTiUyJWYSk/edit?tab=t.0#heading=h.3sfarlt0uip7) that establishes a [new Series LLC model for projects](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ddxjFfABSiubJ9by9P3p9lszNSMetonJGFtV-NEb_Pc/edit?tab=t.0#heading=h.so0m36vqkre0).
